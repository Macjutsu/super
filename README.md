## Introduction

S.U.P.E.R.M.A.N. (or just `super`) is an open source script that provides administrators with a comprehensive solution to encourage and enforce [macOS minor updates, macOS major upgrades,](https://support.apple.com/guide/deployment/about-software-updates-depc4c80847a) [Jamf Pro Policies,](https://learn.jamf.com/en-US/bundle/jamf-pro-documentation-current/page/Policies.html) or enforced system restarts. Deployed using a single script and optional configuration profiles, `super` creates a background agent (aka LaunchDaemon) that ensures updates are applied with the least user interference possible. Further, `super` offers a broad range of options for customizable dialogs, notifications, schedules, deferrals, and deadlines. In other words, `super` makes the macOS update experience better for both users and administrators.
